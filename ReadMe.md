Work in progress color gradient wheel renderer

![Image](../master/example.png?raw=true)

This project was intended for me to learn an algorithm that is on
my 'scary/to conquer' list.

The plans are to make a few neato tools and widgets with it that
will benefit other projects in the future.

It uses vanilla javascript and web canvas API to render
a arbitrarily sized list of colors on a gradient wheel.

Later plans include:
Make friendly UI for managing the colors at each division,
make it run on older browsers (untested besides firefox dev latest),
make an advanced color picker that auto-helps finding matching colors based on integer color quantities
